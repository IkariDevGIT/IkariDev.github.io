        <p>Hey, i finally made the website here have content, and if you are asking "ikari, why tf are you posting so many blog posts, aren't they suposed to be kind of 'special'?"</p>
        <p>To that i answer "Shut up, i need to fill this page so it doesn't look empty!"</p>
        <p>Anyway.. it now looks awesome! And i removed all the lorem impsum shit, + I added, if you open a post in "full screen" it temporarily removes the sidebar for better visibility of the post.</p>
        <h3>Update:</h3>
        <i class="timestamp">14.08.2023 - 00:39 [GMT+2]</i>
        <p>I added a nice looking loading screen, to hide the js magic, and i fixed a couple of things, + quality of life stuff.</p>
        <p>One cool thing i added too, was this vote thingy, if you like a post you can vote it up! (you can for some reason press it multiple times, so if you REALLY like a post you could vote it to like 200 or smth)</p>

        <h3>So i added a couple of cool things</h3>
        <i class="timestamp">12.08.2023 - 23:05 [GMT+2]</i>
        <p>I added a new url arg called "bo", when set to true combined with set blogid arg, it opens it in "fullscreen" mode.</p>
        <p>I also added a little button(Open post), which does the same. When you click share it automatically sets the blogid arg, + it sets "bo" arg to true.</p>
