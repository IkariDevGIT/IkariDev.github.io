        <h3>Collab with Undi / Echidna-13b v0.1, v0.2, v0.3</h3>

        <h4><a href="https://huggingface.co/NeverSleep/Echidna-13b-v0.1">Echidna-13b-v0.1</a></h4>
        <p>Echidna-13b-v0.1 came out 21.10.2023, i wanted to merge it alone first, but had server issues. Thats when i asked Undi to help merge it, we reviewed my recipe and decided to upload it on his <a href="https://huggingface.co/NeverSleep">NeverSleep</a> org and let it be a collab.</p>
        <h4><a href="https://huggingface.co/NeverSleep/Echidna-13b-v0.2">Echidna-13b-v0.2</a></h4>
        <p>Echidna-13b-v0.2 came out 26.10.2023 (took 4~ hours of merging), it was kind of a "test" version of Echidna-13b-v0.3. Echidna-13b-v0.3 would follow soon after.</p>
        <h4><a href="https://huggingface.co/NeverSleep/Echidna-13b-v0.3">Echidna-13b-v0.3</a></h4>
        <p>It took us some time to refine <span class="addspeech addspeechstyle" title="You can look at the recipe on the HF/Modelcard/Readme">Echidna-13b-v0.2's recipe</span>, we had multiple test models(private) which game way better results than Echidna-13b-v0.2.</p>
        <p>The newest version, Echidna-13b-v0.2 came out 27.10.2023 (took 5.30~ hours of merging).</p>
        <p>Repetition seems to be almost non-existant, which is really nice. Undi and me noticed that while trying to let the AI talk to itself(with impersonate).</p>
        <p>Coherency is outstanding, as is creativity.</p>
        <p>This model seems to not have 5 IQ like some other models, for example: a femboy has a dick, not a vagina... It's also really nice at describing things, like scenes. This is probably due to having so much medical data in here.</p>
        <p>Last but not least.. not a single <span class="addspeech rainbow_text_animated" title="<span class='rainbow_text_animated'>Ministrations</span>">"...shiver down X spine..."</span> seen while testing!</p>
        <br>
        <h4 class="rainbow_text_animated" style="font-size: 20px;">Please enjoy!</h4>

        <i class="timestamp">14.08.2023 - 23:17 [GMT+2]</i><div style="padding-top: 20px"></div>
        <p>So i added a little section called "Resources", if you want you can check it out if you wanna look for new stuff programming/ML/LLM/SD or if you are starting out with that stuff.</p>
        <p>You can check it out <a onclick="switchTo(3)">here</a> or you can just click the "resources" button in the Navbar.</p>
        <br>
        <p>One thing i still need to do tho, is making this website better for mobile, as it looks shit currently(i think so at least).</p>

        <h3>Website is finally "done"</h3>
        <i class="timestamp">13.08.2023 - 22:29 [GMT+2]</i><div style="padding-top: 20px"></div>
        <p>Hey, i finally made the website here have content, and if you are asking "ikari, why tf are you posting so many blog posts, aren't they suposed to be kind of 'special'?"</p>
        <p>To that i answer "Shut up, i need to fill this page so it doesn't look empty!"</p>
        <p>Anyway.. it now looks awesome! And i removed all the lorem impsum shit, + I added, if you open a post in "full screen" it temporarily removes the sidebar for better visibility of the post.</p>
        <h3>Update:</h3>
        <i class="timestamp">14.08.2023 - 00:39 [GMT+2]</i><div style="padding-top: 20px"></div>
        <p>I added a nice looking loading screen, to hide the js magic, and i fixed a couple of things, + quality of life stuff.</p>
        <p>One cool thing i added too, was this vote thingy, if you like a post you can vote it up! (you can for some reason press it multiple times, so if you REALLY like a post you could vote it to like 200 or smth)</p>

        <h3>So i added a couple of cool things</h3>
        <i class="timestamp">12.08.2023 - 23:05 [GMT+2]</i><div style="padding-top: 20px"></div>
        <p>I added a new url arg called "bo", when set to true combined with set blogid arg, it opens it in "fullscreen" mode.</p>
        <p>I also added a little button(Open post), which does the same. When you click share it automatically sets the blogid arg, + it sets "bo" arg to true.</p>
