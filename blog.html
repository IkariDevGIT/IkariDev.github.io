        <p>Hey, i finally made the website here have content, and if you are asking "ikari, why tf are you posting so many blog posts, aren't they suposed to be kind of 'spacial'?"</p>
        <p>To that i answer "Shut up, i need to fill this page so it doesn't look empty!"</p>
        <p>Anyway.. it now looks awesome! And i removed all the lorem impsum shit, + I added, if you open a post in "full screen" it temporarily removes the sidebar for better visibility of the post.</p>

        <p>I added a new url arg called "bo", when set to true combined with set blogid arg, it opens it in "fullscreen" mode.</p>
        <p>I also added a little button(Open post), which does the same. When you click share it automatically sets the blogid arg, + it sets "bo" arg to true.</p>
